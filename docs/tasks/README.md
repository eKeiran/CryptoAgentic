# AI Agent and AI Agent UI Development Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the steps and tasks required to develop both the AI Agent and the AI Agent UI. The AI Agent is responsible for processing user inputs, interacting with external services (QuestDB, Grafana, VS Code), and generating responses. The AI Agent UI serves as the user interface for interacting with the AI Agent.

## 2. Development Environment Setup

- **Details**:
  - Add the `ai-agent` and `ai-agent-ui` service definitions.
  - Configure environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `QUESTDB_PG_USER`, `QUESTDB_PG_PASSWORD`, `GRAFANA_API_KEY`, `VSCODE_API_KEY`).
  - Set up dependencies for `ai-agent` on QuestDB, Grafana, and VS Code, and for `ai-agent-ui` on `ai-agent`.
  - Ensure both services are correctly configured and linked.

### 2.2. Dockerfile Creation
- **Task**: Create Dockerfiles for both the AI Agent and AI Agent UI services.
- **Details**:

    - Base the image on a suitable Python image (`python:3.x`).
    - Install required dependencies (e.g., `langchain`, `psycopg2`, `requests`).
    - Copy the AI Agent code and configuration files into the Docker image.
    - Set the appropriate entry point for the AI Agent.
  - **AI Agent UI**:
    - Base the image on a suitable Python image (`python:3.x`).
    - Install Flask and other necessary Python packages.
    - Copy the UI code into the Docker image.
    - Set the appropriate entry point for the Flask application.

### 2.3. Local Environment Setup (Optional)

  - **Tools**: 
    - **psycopg2**: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python that can be used to interact with QuestDB via the PostgreSQL wire protocol.
    - **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for abstracting and simplifying database interactions, which can be configured to work with QuestDB.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Establish a connection to QuestDB using the PostgreSQL wire protocol.
    - Write and execute SQL queries for inserting, updating, and selecting data.
    - Ensure connection pooling and proper handling of database transactions.

  #### 3.3.2. REST API
  - **Use Case**: When you prefer a more lightweight interaction or need to execute specific queries via HTTP requests.
  - **Tools**:
    - **Requests Library**: Use Python's `requests` library to interact with QuestDB's REST API.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Send HTTP requests to QuestDB's REST API endpoints for SQL queries.
    - Handle responses, including parsing JSON data returned by SELECT queries.
    - Implement error handling and retry logic for robust interactions.
  
  #### 3.3.3. Query Optimization and Best Practices
  - **Use Case**: Optimize performance for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Optimize SQL queries by indexing frequently accessed columns.
    - Use batch inserts and updates when dealing with large datasets to reduce overhead.
    - Monitor and analyze query performance, adjusting queries as needed to ensure efficiency.


### 3.4. Integration with Grafana
- **Task**: Set up communication between the AI Agent and Grafana for data visualization.
- **Details**:
  - Use Grafanaâ€™s API to fetch or update dashboards.
  - Implement logic to trigger Grafana visualizations based on user queries.
  - Handle API authentication using the `GRAFANA_API_KEY`.

### 3.5. Integration with VS Code
- **Task**: Implement code-related queries or tasks that interact with VS Code.
- **Details**:
  - Use VS Code API (or custom implementation) to handle code execution, file editing, etc.
  - Manage authentication using the `VSCODE_API_KEY`.
  - Define input/output formats for code-related tasks.
