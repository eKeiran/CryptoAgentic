The Crypto Agentic Lab provides tools for data management, result visualization, and live coding. To boost its usability, we propose pre-built notebooks tailored for crypto-focused data science, including:

**Data Sources:**
- Blockchain data (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin APIs)
- Market data (e.g., Binance, CoinGecko)
- Web scraping for crypto news

**ML Templates:**
- Price prediction, anomaly detection
- Sentiment analysis on crypto discussions
- Clustering and trend analysis

These notebooks simplify crypto experimentation and offer a foundation for new data scientists. Contributions are encouraged to grow and sustain this resource!
